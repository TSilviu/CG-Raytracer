# CG-Raytracer
Extras: 
 - Anti-Aliasing
 - Depth of field
 - Motion Blur 
 - Optimisations: OpenMP, O3 and some simplifications
 - Soft shadows
 - Fully reflective (mirror) surfaces 

Textures require (they can be disabled by changing the define statement from the code and it will compile just fine without them): 
  - CImg library, which requires:
  	- jpeg c library
  	- X11 library (probably already there, but needs to have the right paths)
