To run the program use make (by default it will build the basic version). All make commands will create an executable file, skeleton, in /Build
To test the extension run:
	make textures      #for textures and normal maps
	make dof 		   #depth of field
	make kdtrees	   #renders a custom model using kdtrees
	make mirrors
	make softshadows
	make motionblur
